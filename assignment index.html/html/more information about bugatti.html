        HISTORY
    </h1>
    <p>
        On December 22, 1998, Volkswagen AG, a German automotive manufacturer now controlled by Porsche SE, established
         Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. as a French-registered, wholly-owned subsidiary. On the same day, the company took over the design
          and naming rights to Bugatti from Italian businessman Romano Artioli, who built supercars (such as the EB 110 and EB 112)
           with Bugatti SpA in Italy between 1987 and 1998. Since 2000, the Bugatti automobile brand has officially existed as Bugatti 
           Automobiles S.A.S., still abbreviated to Bugatti. Since then, the company's headquarters have once again been located in
            Molsheim, France.

        On 22 December 2000, Volkswagen officially incorporated Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., with former VW drivetrain chief Karl-Heinz 
        Neumann as president. The company purchased the 1856 Château Saint-Jean, formerly Ettore Bugatti's guest house in Dorlisheim,
         near Molsheim, and began refurbishing it to serve as the company's headquarters. The original factory was still in the hands
         of Snecma, who were unwilling to part with it. At the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August 2000, VW announced that they 
         would instead build a new modern atelier (factory) next to and south of the château. The atelier was officially inaugurated 
         on 3 September 2005.
        
        In September 2020, it was announced that Volkswagen was preparing to sell its Bugatti automobile brand, and talks began with
         the Croatian company Rimac Automobili. Around 700 Bugatti cars had been sold since 2005,[6] but Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert
          Diess saw the unprofitable brand as ballast, the company said.[7]
        
        In 2020, Bugatti delivered 77 vehicles to customers. In January 2021, Bugatti announced that it had increased its operating
         profit for the third year in a row. This marked the most successful year in the company's history.
        
        In July 2021, it was announced that Bugatti Automobiles and the sports car operations of Rimac Automobili will be merged to 
        form Bugatti Rimac, a joint venture between Rimac Group and Porsche AG.[8] The newly formed Rimac Group will be the majority
         shareholder with a 55% stake in Bugatti Rimac, while Porsche AG will hold the remaining 45% stake, as well as a 24% stake in
          Rimac Group.[9] The formation of Bugatti Rimac d.o.o. took place in the fourth quarter of 2021.[3]
        
        After years of building one-offs and limited edition models, in December 2021, Bugatti officially created its own bespoke 
        division – Sur Mesure.[10] The phrase means 'tailored' in French.[10]
    </p>
      <H3>
        Italdesign Giugiaro designs
      </H3>
      <p>
        Volkswagen commissioned Italdesign's Giorgetto Giugiaro to design a series of concept cars to return the marque to prominence.
        [11][12] The first example, the EB 118, was a two-door coupé and was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in 1998.[13] It was
         followed by the four-door EB 218 touring sedan, introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1999. Later that year, the 18/3 Chiron
          was shown at the IAA in Frankfurt.[14]
      </p>
     <h3>
        Volkswagen designs
     </h3>
    <p>
        Volkswagen designed the final Bugatti concept, the EB 18/4 GT in-house. Bugatti introduced the EB 18/4 at the 1999 
        Tokyo Motor Show.
    </p>
    <h3>
        W18 Engine
    </h3>
     <p>
        All of these early concepts featured a 555 PS (408 kW; 547 hp) 18-cylinder engine. This was the first-ever W-configuration
         engine on a passenger vehicle, with three blocks of 6 cylinders each. It shared many components with Volkswagen's modular
          engine family.
     </p>
     <h3>
        16C Galibier
     </h3>
    <p>
        The 16C Galibier was unveiled during the Celebration of the Centenary of the Marque in Molsheim.
         The presentation was only for Bugatti customers. The car show in Molsheim showed the car in blue carbon fibre and aluminum 
         parts. One year later Bugatti showed the world the 16C Galibier Concept at "VW Group Night" at the Geneva Auto Show in a new 
         black and aluminum color combination.

The Galibier, a 1020 HP sedan, was first shown as a concept in 2010 and when they planned to put it into production in 2015,
 it would have cost about $1.4 million. It would use the same 16-cylinder 8.0-litre engine as the Veyron but instead of four turbos,
  the 16C Galibier would instead use two superchargers to deliver better torque. Production would require new facilities in Molsheim,
   France, to be refitted, which pushed back potential deliveries until 2015.[15]

In 2013, it was announced that the car will never be produced as they wish to focus on a Veyron replacement.
    </p>
    <h3>
        EB 110
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the 1980s the Bugatti brand was brought back as Bugatti Automobili S.p.A. in Italy. The company produced the EB 110
         in the 1990s, which put Bugatti back on the modern super-car scene. The company was then bought by Volkswagen at the end 
         of the 20th century.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Veyron
    </h3>
    <p>
        In 2000, the company introduced a new engine concept. At the Paris, Geneva, and Detroit auto shows, Bugatti presented
         the EB 16/4 Veyron concept car, an all-wheel-drive 16-cylinder car with an engine output of 1,001 PS (736 kW; 987 hp).
          The EB 16/4 Veyron has an 8.0-liter engine with four turbochargers. It reached a top speed of 407 km/h (253 mph).
           At the time, the Veyron was the most potent and fastest supercar ever built. In acceleration tests, it reached a speed
            of 100 km/h (62 mph) after 2.5 s, 200 km/h (124 mph) after 7.3 s, and 300 km/h (186 mph) after 16.8 s.

Development initially lasted until 2001; the EB 16/4 Veyron was given "advanced concept" status in advertising. At the end of 2001,
 Bugatti announced that the car was now officially called the Bugatti Veyron 16.4. The combination of numbers means 16 cylinders and a
  fourth design study. Initially, production was scheduled to start in 2003. Technical difficulties with the dual-clutch transmission 
  and the unusual, extreme requirements at speeds well over 300 km/h led to several delays. Finally, production began in September
   2005, and annual production was increased to 70 units due to long waiting times.[16]

On June 26, 2010, the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport set the world speed record for road-legal production sports cars with a 
top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.86 mph). In August of the same year, this vehicle with 1,200 PS (883 kW; 1,184 hp) was presented
 for the first time in Pebble Beach (U.S.).[17] In April 2013, the Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse reached 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph),
  the fastest speed ever recorded for a roadster. The Vitesse World Record Car Edition, limited to eight units, was subsequently
   presented to the world public for the first time at the Auto Shanghai trade show and sold out shortly after that.[18]

At the 2015 IAA, the company unveiled a show car of its Vision Gran Turismo project. With the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo, 
the luxury manufacturer presented a possible new super sports car following the sale of all 450 Veyron.[19] The Bugatti Vision
 Gran Turismo design is intended to recall the racing tradition of the 1920s and 1930s. The color scheme represents the brand's
  victories in the Le Mans 24-hour race. On November 6, 2015, the first showrooms in Bugatti's new CI look were opened simultaneously.

   <h3>
    Chiron
   </h3>
   <p>
    On November 30, 2015, Bugatti announced that the successor to the Veyron would be called the Chiron. The name is dedicated 
    to the Monegasque racing driver Louis Chiron, who began his racing career on a Bugatti Type 35 and won several Grand Prix races.
    [21] On February 29, 2016, Bugatti unveiled its new Chiron hypercar at the Geneva Motor Show. It continues to be powered by an
     8.0-liter 16-cylinder with four turbochargers, but now with 1,500 PS (1,103 kW; 1,479 hp) and 1,600 Newton meters of torque. 
     The Chiron accelerates to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.4 seconds from a standstill, reaches 200 km/h (124 mph) in 6.1 seconds, and 
     300 km/h (186 mph) in 13.1 seconds. The top speed is 420 km/h (261 mph). Bugatti is the only automaker to build a W16 engine
      that produces over 1,500 hp. Since 2016, the Chiron has been home to the first mass-produced 3-D printed component, a small
       console on the transmission oil duct.[22]

    This makes the Chiron the fastest hypercar globally, and its base price is 2.4 million euros net. Production in Molsheim is 
    limited to 500 vehicles, and the first production car was delivered to customers in March 2017. The Chiron made its debut on 
    the US market in April 2016. On August 21, 2016, Bugatti unveiled the Vision Gran Turismo concept car, a real-life study of the
     vehicle in the Gran Turismo Sport video game.[23] On September 11, 2017, the Chiron set a new world record. From 0 to 400 km/h 
     (249 mph) and back to 0 km/h (0 mph), the coupé took just 42 seconds.[24]
    
    The BBC's TopGear magazine named the Chiron "hypercar of the year" on November 27, 2017, and a month later, the Chiron also
     received the award from Evo magazine in the UK.[25][26]
    
    At the Geneva Motor Show on March 6, 2018, Bugatti unveiled the Chiron Sport, a hypercar optimized for lateral acceleration.
     It takes 5 seconds off the Chiron on the Nardò handling circuit thanks to numerous changes, such as the increased use of new
      materials (the first production car with windshield wipers made of carbon), the resulting weight saving of 18 kilograms, and 
      the new Dynamic Torque Vectoring function. The engine remains untouched, producing 1,103 kW (1,479 hp) and 1,600 Newton-meters
       of torque, as in the Chiron.[27] In June 2018, Lego Technic recreated a 1:8 scale Chiron with Lego bricks.[28]
    
    In November 2018, Lego collaborated with Bugatti to design a 1:1 scale Chiron made of Lego bricks.[29] The full-size Lego Technic
     Chiron was constructed from over 1,000,000 Lego pieces, produced an estimated 5.3 horsepower and 92Nm of torque, could travels at
      speeds of up to 20 kph, and required over 13,000 work hours to design and construct.
    
    In 2019, Bugatti ringed in its 110th anniversary with the unique "110ans" edition of the Chiron Sport.[30] The hypercar adorns the
     Tricolore inside and out as a nod to France. The powertrain remains the 8-liter 16-cylinder with four turbochargers and 1,103 
     kW/1,500 hp. The vehicle was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show.[31]
    
    In July 2019, Bugatti built the 200th Chiron, as "110 ans Bugatti".
    
    In September 2019, Bugatti broke through the 300 mph barrier with a modified Chiron, breaking the top speed record. Ex-racing 
    driver and test driver Andy Wallace reached 304.773 mph (490.485 km/h) on the VW test track in Ehra-Lessien. The Chiron thus
     becomes the first production car to exceed 300 mph (483 km/h).[32]
    
    Bugatti celebrated its 110th birthday with customers and friends of the brand at the Grand Fête in Molsheim in September 2019
     and unveiled the Chiron Super Sport 300+ as part of the celebration.[33][34] The car, which has been boosted to 1,600 hp, has
     
     a body optimized for top speed and was limited to 30 units. One vehicle cost 3.5 million euros.[32][35]
    
    The French introduced another derivative, the Chiron Pur Sport, in March 2020.[36] The new model was developed and designed 
    with lateral dynamics in mind. To achieve this, the engineers modified the chassis, engine, transmission, and aerodynamics. 
    A new transmission improved with a 15 percent shorter overall ratio; total power is available at 350 km/h (217 mph). The Chiron
     Pur Sport accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.3 seconds instead of 2.4 seconds, and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) now takes
      5.9 seconds instead of 6.1 seconds. The vehicle's top speed is electronically governed at 350 km/h (217 mph), and the maximum
       gearshift speed is 6,900 rpm. At the rear, the Chiron Pur Sport carries a 1.90-meter-wide rear wing for massive downforce. 
       A new chassis set-up with stiffer springs at the front and back, a control strategy for the adaptive dampers designed for 
       performance, and modified camber values ensured more dynamic handling and greater agility in corners. The Chiron Pur Sport
        is limited to 60 vehicles and costs 3 million euros each. The first vehicle was delivered in August 2020.
    
    In September, Bugatti presented the special Chiron Sport model "Les Légendes du Ciel." Limited to 20 units, the edition is
     dedicated to Bugatti's legendary pilots and works drivers. Each vehicle costs 2.88 million euros net.[37]

    <h3>
        Divo
    </h3>
    <p>
        In July 2018, Bugatti announced that it would build 40 units of the Divo hypercar, a track-focused vehicle based on the Chiron.
        [38][39] The cars, at a net unit price of €5 million, were sold within days.[40] In August 2018, the Divo was shown to the
         public for the first time at "The Quail: A Motorsports Gathering" as part of Monterey Car Week.[41][42] With the Divo,
          Bugatti began modern coachbuilding.
    </p>
      <h3>
        La Voiture Noire
      </h3>
      <p>
        The La Voiture Noire (The Black Car) was a special edition car built and sold by Bugatti in 2019. It was presented at the 
        2019 Geneva Motor Show.
        [47][48] The car pays homage to the legendary 'missing' Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic of Jean Bugatti.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Centodieci
      </h3>
      <p>
        In August 2019, Bugatti presented the "Centodieci" (Italian for 110) at "The Quail: A Motorsports Gathering" as part
         of Monterey Car Week.[49] The hypercar "reinterprets the historic EB 110."[50][51] It is based on the Bugatti Chiron
          with its 8.0-liter W16 engine, but in the Centodieci, it produces 1,600 PS (1,177 kW; 1,578 hp) at 7,000 rpm.[52] An
           additional air intake in the area of the oil cooler regulates the temperature of the performance-enhanced engine.
            In purely arithmetical terms, the Centodieci will sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, to 200 km/h
             (124 mph) in 6.1 seconds and 300 km/h (186 mph) in 13.1 seconds, with the top speed, electronically capped at 380 km/h
              (236 mph). Visually, its wedge shape is based on the EB 110. The small series, limited to ten vehicles at a unit price
               of eight million euros, was sold immediately.[53][54][55]
